# LightTimer
Project idea: Use an arduino to control outdoor lights by having it connect to the internet and turn the lights on and off based on sunrise and sunset. It works like most outdoor timers where you connect a plug and it controls the electric flow. This version is simpler than all the rest because it needs no configuration.
